# Advanced ML Model Enhancement Ideas

## 1. Multi-Model Ensemble System
- Combine multiple algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- Weighted voting system for better accuracy
- Real-time model performance monitoring

## 2. Deep Learning Integration
- LSTM for URL sequence analysis
- CNN for visual page content analysis
- Transformer models for context understanding

## 3. Real-time Learning
- Online learning capabilities
- User feedback integration
- Automatic model retraining pipeline

## 4. Advanced Feature Engineering
- DNS analysis and reputation scoring
- WHOIS data integration
- SSL certificate validation
- Page content analysis (HTML, JavaScript)
- Social media reputation scores
- Traffic pattern analysis

## 5. Multi-language Support
- International domain analysis
- Punycode detection
- Unicode homograph attack detection

## Implementation Priority:
1. Ensemble model (Week 1-2)
2. Real-time features (Week 3-4)
3. Deep learning (Month 2)
4. Advanced features (Month 3)
